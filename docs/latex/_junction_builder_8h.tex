void build\+Junction\+Box (\begin{DoxyParamCaption}{}{}\end{DoxyParamCaption})}



Build a junction box based on the provided specifications. 

This function is responsible for constructing a junction box by utilizing available data such as device and cable information. It involves generating the layout, placing components appropriately within the Auto\+CAD environment, and ensuring all connections are accurately represented.

The process may include reading from an Excel file to gather necessary input data, interacting with Auto\+CAD for drawing purposes, and managing various attributes related to devices and cables. It serves as a core functionality of the Junction Diagram Automation Suite.
